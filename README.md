# About Dataset
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data

This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

# Project Objective

Due to the limited information in this dataset, the project's goal is to conduct basic analyses on revenue and order trends, the popular product categories, customer and seller performance, as well as delivery time and review scores. Through these analyses, the aim is to provide recommendations for new sellers who wish to enter this online platform.
The questions to be answered in this project include: 

- What product categories should be sold? 
- Where is the potential market? 
- When should sales occur?

# Techniques:

Python
Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

# Insights and recommendations:

# Challenge:
The challenge I faced is a lack of domain knowledge, and the dataset is too broad to analyze in order to define the main question and find key ideas to support it.
