Project Description

The data of this project came from kaggle (Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist). Our team firstly formed a big question about what are the product that were becoming popular as well as those that received fewer support by customers. Nevertheless, we then redirected our big questions into helping new sellers who try to join this online platflorm and used the original big question as a key point to help answer the new question. We firstly try to apply data cleaning and then do some visualizations on finding top trending products. Then we draw charts and defined specific time zone in which customers paid the most and lastly we analyzed comments left by customers in order to find out what are the problems customer usually criticised about.

Throughout the entire project, we used various of techniques in visualizing as well as cleaning / selecting relavants columns from the dataset such as seaborn countplot, pivot table, convert long from to wide form, etc. Furthermore, we also used scikit learn to apply machine learning for analyzing comments, grouping comments into top 10 topics and defined top mentioned term. For example: I still received product, I did not recieve the product, etc.

The big problems we had is to define the big question and find key ideas to support it. Not only did the big question need to be attractive and realistic, but also the key ideas to support it had to be indepth and clearness.
